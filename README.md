# NameSelector
hello,
this is first programm that i wrote using java,\n
program helps user to choose a name for example for a child if user cannot decide betweek few options\n
it lets you provide names that you want to choose from, no limit of names so far implemented,\n
you can choose one random name from provided ones \n
or make a number of random choises, user can choose how many times it should be, \n
in that case user will receive names with number of how many times each name was choosen, it will be sorted for the most to the lease choosen name\n
\n
i.e. \n
user provedes 3 names: James, Bob, Kevin and want to make 100 choices,\n
program will return:\n
Bob 40\n
James 35\n
Kevin 25\n
